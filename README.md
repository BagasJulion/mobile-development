2. Location and Calculation: use mechine learning : By utilizing machine learning and cloud computing, a mobile application can select a location based on user preferences. Subsequently, geographical coordinate data (longitude and latitude) is sent to the cloud computing system. There, the data is processed using a machine learning model to obtain the required location information. This location is then used to access the NASA API dataset, encompassing data from 1984 to 2023. After obtaining the CSV file from this dataset, the data is employed to predict conditions for the next two years.
The results of the two-year prediction are sent back to the cloud computing system using flash technology. Furthermore, the cloud computing system transmits information about energy availability and prices to the mobile application for necessary calculations.
